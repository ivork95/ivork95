## About Me

Hi there! I'm Idan Vork, a recent graduate from Codam Coding College in Amsterdam. During my studies, I gained in-depth technical expertise and developed a passion for coding and technology. As a full stack developer, I have a strong background in both front-end and back-end development, with particular proficiency in C/C++, Python.

I'm currently seeking my next adventure in the tech industry where I can apply my skills, learn new technologies, and contribute to exciting projects. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always eager to tackle new challenges. Let's build something amazing together!

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you'd like to connect.
